This project involves exploring cutting-edge techniques in distributed stream processing, including partitioning strategies, dynamic scheduling, and performance modeling. Students will develop or extend existing frameworks to handle massive and high-velocity data streams.

### Focus
Designing and evaluating novel algorithms and system architectures for real-time data processing in large-scale, heterogeneous environments (e.g., cloud-edge networks). Emphasis on resource allocation, parallelism, and load balancing to achieve high throughput and low latency.

### Tasks
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Create adaptive load balancing and scheduling strategies.  
- **Scalability Mechanisms:** Explore partitioning, parallelism, and distributed execution techniques.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Develop benchmarks and simulation frameworks for empirical validation.  

### Required Skills

**Theoretical Skills:**  
- Distributed Systems Concepts  
- Scalability and Performance Modeling  
- Queueing Theory / Scheduling Algorithms  

**Practical Skills:**  
- Programming in Java, Scala, or Python  
- Familiarity with Apache Spark, Flink, or Storm  
- Cloud Deployment (AWS/Azure)
