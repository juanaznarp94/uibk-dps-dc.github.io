This project focuses on extending a novel programming model for the Cloud-Edge-IoT continuum. Students will develop and research tools to simplify application development and explore multiple aspects of the programming model.

### Tasks
- **Visual Programming Languages:** Provide a visual counterpart to the existing programming language.  
- **Validation/Verification:** Validate and verify applications written in the language.  
- **Live Visualization and Performance Analysis:** Analyze the performance of deployed applications in real time.  
- **Application Development and Comparison:** Develop novel use cases/applications using the programming model and compare them against other well-known programming models.  

### Required Skills

**Theoretical Skills:**  
- Cloud Computing  
- Visual Programming Languages  
- Validation/Verification  

**Practical Skills:**  
- Java Programming  
- General Software Development Skills  

### Additional Information
- The project scope can encompass multiple topics.  
- Preferably two students work together on the project.  
- Inspiration can be derived from NodeRED, Simulink, and Ballerina.
