This project investigates the challenges of processing continuous data streams where unexpected anomalies or failures may occur. Students will design and implement algorithms that not only detect unusual patterns or outliers in streaming data but also trigger corrective actions (e.g., checkpointing, reconfiguration, or alerting) to ensure overall system reliability.

### Focus
Developing robust methods for detecting anomalies in real time while ensuring fault tolerance within distributed stream processing systems. Integration of advanced anomaly detection algorithms with self-healing and recovery strategies to maintain system integrity and performance amid data irregularities and system failures.

### Tasks
- **Anomaly Detection Algorithms:** Develop and evaluate both statistical and machine learning methods tailored for streaming data.  
- **Fault Tolerance Mechanisms:** Design self-healing and recovery strategies to maintain consistency during system failures.  
- **Integration of Detection and Recovery:** Create mechanisms that trigger automated fault-tolerance procedures upon anomaly detection.  
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation:** Set up real-world scenarios and synthetic benchmarks to assess performance, latency, and reliability under various fault conditions.  

### Required Skills

**Theoretical Skills:**  
- Statistical Analysis  
- Time-Series Modeling  
- Machine Learning for Streaming Data  
- Distributed Systems and Fault Tolerance Theories  

**Practical Skills:**  
- Programming in Python, Java, or Scala  
- Experience with Streaming Frameworks (e.g., Apache Flink, Spark Streaming)  
- Familiarity with Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
