The **SPICE project** addresses the growing scale and complexity of the Cloud, which has led to the emergence of Edge and IoT computing within the "compute continuum" — an ecosystem crucial for applications relying on sensor data and time-critical, AI-assisted data processing. The aim is to enable intelligent decision-making and provide deeper insights across this continuum, while overcoming the numerous technical, operational, and organizational challenges in assembling and maintaining robust data pipelines.

# Objectives

The SPICE project’s core mission is to **radically simplify** complex, distributed data processing and deliver a secure, trustworthy, and adaptable platform for **SMART data pipelines**.  

Key objectives include:

1. **AI-assisted composition** of smart data pipelines for streamlined and automated configuration of complex workflows.  
2. **Optimized execution environments and resource management** to enable secure, smart, and efficient data processing across IoT–Edge–Cloud.  
3. **Secure and trustworthy design** ensuring quality, performance, and dependability in data analytics.  
4. Establishing an **innovation transformation incubator** to foster adoption and exploitation of the project’s outcomes.  

## Relevance

Data pipelines are the backbone of intelligent data processing in the compute continuum. They systematically ingest, move, process, and analyze vast volumes of data from **heterogeneous and widely dispersed sources**, leveraging both compute and storage capabilities across IoT, Edge, and Cloud environments.

> The project aims to deliver a **human-centric, trustworthy, energy-aware, and fair AI system** for distributed industrial and scientific decision-making.

The SPICE platform will provide:
- A **semantically enriched, platform-agnostic, and secured data pipeline composition and execution environment**.  
- **Automatic resource management** tailored to performance and quality demands.  
- Compatibility with European initiatives such as the **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)** and **European common data spaces**.  

By addressing scalability, adaptability, and trustworthiness, SPICE will remove barriers to widespread adoption of advanced data pipelines and set a new standard for distributed AI-driven data processing.
