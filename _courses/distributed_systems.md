This course offers an in-depth exploration of distributed systems, combining theoretical foundations with highly practical, hands-on experience. Students will gain a deep understanding of core concepts such as fault tolerance, consistency, scalability, replication, and performance analysis, while learning to design, implement, and deploy complex distributed applications across the Cloud-Edge continuum.

The course is closely aligned with a practical proseminar, where students will work directly with industry-standard tools and platforms, including AWS, containerization technologies, serverless computing, and deployment pipelines. Through this immersive approach, participants not only master the principles of distributed systems but also acquire the real-world skills needed to build, manage, and optimize scalable and reliable applications in modern cloud environments.

By the end of the course, students will be fully equipped to tackle challenges in distributed computing, from modeling and scheduling to data management and coordination, preparing them for advanced research or professional practice in cutting-edge distributed technologies.
